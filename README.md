The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
# Dataset :

   1. Model training.
   2. Model Evaluation.
   3. Testing the model.
# Applications of Machine Learning :
     1. Speech Recognition: Speech recognition uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to process human speech into written format and vice versa. Some examples are – Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri.
     2. Recommendation Engine: Using the past behavior of a human’s search data the recommendation engine can produce new data to cross-sell products to customers. For example – Amazon product recommendations, Spotify music recommendations.
